# HOW TO LABEL (read first)
# - Rows are grouped by the same `url`. For each URL, choose the single best article body candidate.
# - Set the last column `label` to 1 for that row only; leave the others at 0.
# - Prefer candidates with: higher `len`, reasonable `pc` (paragraphs), low `ld` (link density), `sem` = 1, small `boiler`.
# - If your CSV header includes `xpath`, copy the XPath into DevTools to locate the node:
#     * In Chrome DevTools Console:  $x('THE_XPATH')
#     * Or: document.evaluate('THE_XPATH', document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue
# - If this file does not have an `xpath` column yet, future runs will migrate to a new header with `xpath` automatically.
# - Tip: Label a few URLs end‑to‑end, train, and iterate.
