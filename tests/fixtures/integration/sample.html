        This is a sample article with a missspelled word. It contains multiple
        sentences to ensure the text exceeds two hundred characters, allowing
        the parser to avoid triggering any slow rescue logic during tests. The
        additional filler content keeps the example realistic while providing
        ample length for analysis and spelling checks.

      <p>Another short paragraph keeps the document realistic.</p>
