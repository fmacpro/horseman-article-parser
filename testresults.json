        "raw": "in the united kingdom an act of parliament is primary legislation passed by the parliament of the united kingdom.[1][2] as a result of the glorious revolution and the assertion of parliamentary sovereignty any such act is in theory supreme law that can not be overturned by any body other than parliament although it has been recognised through the united kingdom's membership of the european union that acts or parts of acts which conflict with eu law can be disapplied. an act of parliament can be enforced in all 4 of the uk constituent countries (england scotland wales and northern ireland) however as a result of devolution the majority of acts that are now passed by parliament apply either to england and wales only or england only whilst generally acts only relating to constitutional and reserved matters now apply to the whole of the united kingdom. a draft piece of legislation is called a bill when this is passed by parliament and given royal assent it becomes an act and part of statute law. classification of legislation[edit] acts of parliament are classified as either \"public general acts\" or \"local and personal acts\" (also known as private acts\"). bills are also classified as \"public\" \"private\" or hybrid\". public general acts[edit] public general acts form the largest category of legislation in principle affecting the public general law applying to everyone across the entire united kingdom (or at least to 1 or more of its constituent countries of england northern ireland scotland or wales).[3] most public general acts proceed through parliament as a public bill occasionally however a bill is treated as hybrid. local and personal acts (private acts)[edit] private acts are either local or personal in their effect applying to a specifically named locality or legal person in a manner different from all others. private bills are usually promoted by organisations like local authorities or private companies to give themselves powers beyond or in conflict with the general law. private bills only change the law as it applies to specific individuals or organisations rather than the general public. groups or individuals potentially affected by these changes can petition parliament against the proposed bill and present their objections to committees of mps and lords.\"[4] they include acts to confer powers on certain local authorities a recent example being the canterbury city council bill which makes provisions relating to street trading and consumer protection in the city.[4] private bills can also affect certain companies the northern bank bill allowed the statutory right of northern bank to issue bank notes to be transferred to danske bank which had acquired it.[5]other private bills may affect particular companies established by act of parliament such as tsb bank and transas. personal acts are a sub category of private acts which confer specific rights or duties on a named individual or individuals for example allowing 2 persons to marry even though they are within a \"prohibited degree of consanguinity or affinity\" such as stepfather and stepdaughter. private bills common in the 19th century, are now rare as new planning legislation introduced in the 1960 removed the need for many of them;[6] only a few if any are passed each year. parliamentary authorities maintain a list of all private bills before parliament. hybrid bills[edit] hybrid bills combine elements of both public and private bill. while they propose to make changes to the general law they also contain provisions applying to specific individuals or bodies. recent examples are the crossrail bill a hybrid bill to build a railway across london from west to east,[7]and the 1976 aircraft and shipbuilding industries bill which was a particularly controversial bill that was ruled to be a hybrid bill forcing the government to withdraw some of its provisions to allow its passage as a public bill. once passed hybrid bills are printed as part of the public general acts. parliamentary authorities maintain a list of all hybrid bills before parliament. other types of classification[edit] private members bills[edit] it is important not to confuse private bills with private members bills which are public bills intended to effect a general change in the law. the only difference from other public bills is that they are brought forward by a private member (a backbencher) rather than by the government.[8] twenty private members bills per session are allowed to be introduced with the sponsoring private members selected by a ballot of the whole house and additional bills may be introduced under the ten minute rule. financial bills[edit] financial bills raise revenue and authorise how money is spent. the best known such bills are the (normally annual) finance bills introduced by the chancellor of the exchequer in the budget. this usually encompasses all the changes to be made to tax law for the year. its formal description is a bill to grant certain duties to alter other duties and to amend the law relating to the national debt and the public revenue and to make further provision in connection with finance\".[9]consolidated fund and appropriation bills authorise government spending.[10] housekeeping bills[edit] this type of bill is designed to keep the business of government and public affairs up to date. these bills may not be substantial or controversial in party political terms.2 sub classes of the housekeeping bill are consolidation bills which set out existing law in a clearer and more up to date form without changing its substance and the tax law rewrite bills[are there enough of these to constitute a class?] which do the same for tax law.[10] delegated legislation[edit] an act of parliament will often confer power on the queen in council a minister or another public body to create delegated legislation usually by means of a statutory instrument. stages of a bill[edit] a representation of the legislative procedure. bills may start their passage in either the house of commons or house of lords although bills which are mainly or entirely financial will start in the commons. each bill passes through the following stages: consultation drafting and pre legislative scrutiny[edit] although not strictly part of the legislative process a period of consultation will take place before a bill is drafted. within government the treasury and other departments with an interest will be consulted along with the devolved administrations in scotland wales and northern ireland. outside government interested parties such as trade unions industry bodies and pressure groups will be asked for their views on any proposals. the cabinet office code of practice specifies a minimum consultation period of 12 weeks.. consultation documents are widely circulated (see for example the home officeconsultation on extreme pornography[permanent dead link] and the scottish government's consultation on food policy). the character of the consultation is shaped by the government's determination to press forward with a particular set of proposals. a government may publish a green paper outlining various legislative options or a white paper which is a clear statement of intent.[11] it is increasingly common for a small number of government bills to be published in draft before they are presented in parliament. these bills are then considered either by the relevant select committee of the house of commons or by an ad hoc joint committee of both houses. this provides an opportunity for the committee to express a view on the bill and propose amendments before it is introduced. draft bills allow more lengthy scrutiny of potential legislation and have been seen as a response to time pressures which may result in the use of programme orders to impose a strict timetable on the passage of bills and what is known as \"drafting on the hoof\" where the government introduces amendments to its own bills. with increased time for scrutiny backed up with considered evidence draft bills may present governments with difficulty in getting their way.[12] the sponsoring government department will then write to the relevant policy committee of the cabinet. the proposals are only discussed at a meeting if disagreements arise. even an uncontroversial proposal may face administrative hurdles. a potential change in the law may have to wait for a more extensive bill in that policy area to be brought forward before it is worthwhile devoting parliamentary time to it. the proposal will then be bundled together with more substantive measures in the same bill. the ministerial committee on the legislative programme (lp) including the leaders and government chief whips in both houses is responsible for the timetable of legislation. this committee decides which house a bill will start in recommends to the cabinet which proposals will be in the queen's speech which will be published in draft and how much parliamentary time will be required.[11] following a process of consultation the sponsoring department will send drafting instructions to parliamentary counsel expert lawyers working for the government responsible for writing legislation. these instructions will describe what the bill should do but not the detail of how this is achieved. the parliamentary counsel must draft the legislation clearly to minimise the possibility of legal challenge and to fit the bill in with existing uk european union and delegated legislation. a finished bill must be approved or scrutinised by the sponsoring department and minister parliamentary counsel and lp.[13] the final stage is the submission of the bill to the authorities of the house in which it is to start its legislative journey. in the commons this is the clerk of legislation and the public bill office in the lords. they will check the following:[14] that the bill complies with the rules of the house that everything in the bill is covered by its \"long title\" (text describing the purposes of the bill) in the commons that every provision requiring expenditure or levying taxes is identified and printed in italics whether the royal prerogative is affected whether it conflicts with or duplicates any bill which has already been introduced after this process the bill is then ready for introduction.1st reading[edit] the 1st reading is a formality and no debate or vote occurs. a notice that a bill is being presented for its 1st reading appears on the order paper for that day. the european union (amendment) bill appeared on the order paper for 17 december 2007 as follows: notice of presentation of bill1 european union (amendment) [no debate] Secretary David Miliband bill to make provision in connection with the treaty of lisbon amending the treaty on european union and the treaty establishing the european community signed at lisbon on 13th december 2007. formal 1st reading no debate or decision.[15] as we can see in this video footage of the 1st reading the mp is called by the speaker at the commencement of public business and brings a \"dummy bill\" a sheet of paper with the short and long titles and the names of up to 12 supporters, to the clerk of the house at the table. the clerk reads out the short title and the speaker says \"second reading what day?\" for all government bills the response is almost always \"tomorrow\" (or the next sitting day). a date is also set for private members bills the decision for scheduling such bills is crucial as they are not given \"government time\" to be debated. the bill is recorded in the proceedings as having been read for a 1st time having been ordered to be printed and to be read a 2nd time on a particular date.[16] in the case of a government bill explanatory notes which try to explain the effect of the bill in more simple language are also usually ordered to be printed. again in the case of the european union (amendment) bill this appeared in hansard as follows: secretary david miliband supported by the prime minister mr. chancellor of the exchequer mr. secretary straw secretary jacqui smith secretary des browne secretary alan johnson mr. secretary alexander mr. secretary hutton and mr. jim murphy presented a bill to make provision in connection with the treaty of lisbon amending the treaty on european union and the treaty establishing the european community signed at lisbon on 13th december 2007: and the same was read the first time ordered to be read a 2nd time tomorrow and to be printed. explanatory notes to be printed [bill 48]. a bill introduced in this way is known as a presentation bill. bills can also be introduced in the commons by being brought in from the lords being brought in by resolution (like the finance bill) or when an mp gets leave to bring in a ten minute rule bill. a government bill can be introduced 1st into either house. bills which begin in the lords have \"[lords]\" suffixed to its title when in the lords and \"[hl]\" when in the commons.[8] bills which deal primarily with taxation or public expenditure begin their passage in the commons since the financial privileges of that house mean that it has primacy in these matters (see parliament acts 1911 and 1949 conversely bills relating to the judicial system law commission bills and consolidation bills begin their passage in the house of lords which by convention has primacy in these matters.2nd reading[edit] in the 2nd reading which in theory is supposed to occur 2 weekends after the 1st reading a debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote. this is the main opportunity to debate the principle of the bill rather than individual clauses. a division at this stage therefore represents a direct challenge to the principle of the bill. if the bill is read a 2nd time it proceeds to the committee stage. normally the 2nd reading of a government bill is approved. a defeat for a government bill on this reading usually signifies a major loss. the last time this happened was at the 2nd reading of the shops bill for the government of margaret thatcher in 1986. the bill which liberalised controls on sunday trading was defeated in the commons by 14 votes.[17][18]2nd reading debates on government bills usually take 1 day in practice about 6 hours.. smaller and less controversial bills will receive less time and wholly uncontroversial measures will receive a second reading \"on the nod\" with no debate whatsoever.[19] the national insurance contributions bill appeared in the order papers as follows: main business3 national insurance contributions bill 2nd reading. [until 10 p.m.] debate may continue until 10 p.m. as we can see from video footage of the debate for this bill 2nd readings of government bills take place on a motion moved (for government bills) by a minister in the department responsible for the legislation \"that the bill now be read a 2nd time\" the minister outlines the overall purpose of the bill and highlights particular parts of the bill they consider most important. the official opposition spokesperson responds with his or her views on the bill. the debate continues with other opposition parties and backbench mps giving their opinions on the principles of the bill.[20] the minister will eventually bring the debate to a conclusion by saying of the bill \"i commend it to the house\" the speaker will then put the question by saying for example \"the question is that the bill be now read a 2nd time\" the speaker then invites supporters of the bill to say \"aye\" and then opponents say 1st he says \"all members of that opinion say \"aye\" and supporters say \"aye\" then the speaker says \"contrary \"no\" and opponents say \"no\" in what is known as collecting the voices the speaker makes a judgement as to the loudest cry. a clear majority either way will prompt the response \"i think the ayes/noes have it\" (this can be forced to a division by continued cries either way). if the result is at all in doubt a division will be called and the speaker will say division. clear the lobby this refers not to the division lobbies used for voting but the members lobby beyond the chamber which is cleared by the doorkeepers. at this point division bells will ring throughout the palace and also in nearby flats pubs and restaurants whose owners pay to be connected to the system. this allows mps who may not be in the debate to come and vote on the issue in question. after 2 minutes, the speaker will put the question again to assess whether there is still disagreement. he will then name the tellers whose job it is to count the votes. these will usually be government and opposition whips. in the example we have looked at \"tellers for the ayes mr. dave watts and mr. steve mccabe tellers for the noes mr. nick hurd and mr. john baron\" if no teller has come forward (or only 1 the speaker declares the result for the other side.1 teller from each side goes to the end of each division lobby and they count mps as they emerge. whips are also at the other end of the lobby to try to ensure that their mps vote with the party line. the names are taken by division clerks and are published in hansard the next day (see example from hansard or with greater clarity from the public whip).8 minutes after 1st calling the division the speaker says \"lock the doors\" the doorkeepers lock the doors leading into the lobbies and no more mps can get in to vote. when every member has passed the division clerks and tellers a division slip is produced by the clerks at the table and is given to 1 of the tellers on the winning side. the tellers then form up at the table in front of the mace facing the speaker and the teller with the slip reads the result to the house for example the ayes to the right 291. the noes to the left 161 the clerk then takes the slip to the speaker who repeats the result and adds so the ayes have it the ayes have it. unlock. the doorkeepers then unlock the doors to the division lobbies.[21] a division vote concerning a national insurance contributions bill is illustrated from hansard as follows: question put that the bill be now read a 2nd time:- the house divided ayes 291 noes 161. division no. 33 7.56 pm ayes [followed by list of mps and tellers who voted aye] noes [followed by list of mps and tellers who voted no] question accordingly agreed to. bill read a 2nd time.[22] divisions on 2nd readings can be on a straight opposition or a vote on a \"reasoned amendment\" detailing the reasons the bill's opponents do not want it read a 2nd time which may be selected by the speaker. bills defeated at a 2nd reading can not progress further or be reintroduced with exactly the same wording in the same session. procedural orders and resolutions[edit] in the case of government bills the house normally passes forthwith (i.e. without debate but almost always with a vote) a programme order in the form of a programme motion setting out the timetable for the committee and remaining stages of the bill. this takes place immediately after the 2nd reading.[17] for example: national insurance contributions bill (programme) motion made and question put forthwith pursuant to standing order no. 83 (programme motions), that the following provisions shall apply to the national insurance contributions bill: Committal1 the bill shall be committed to a public bill committee. proceedings in public bill committee.2 proceedings in the public bill committee shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion on 22nd january 2008.3. the public bill committee shall have leave to sit twice on the 1st day on which it meets. consideration and third reading4 proceedings on consideration shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion 1 hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which those proceedings are commenced.5 proceedings on third reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion at the moment of interruption on that day.6. standing order no. 83 (programming committees) shall not apply to proceedings on consideration and third reading. other proceedings7. any other proceedings on the bill (including any proceedings on consideration of lords amendments or on any further messages from the lords) may be programmed. -[tony cunningham.] question agreed to.[23] the house may also pass a separate money resolution authorising any expenditure arising from the bill and or a ways and means resolution authorising any new taxes or charges the bill creates. bills are not programmed in the house of lords.[17] committee stage[edit] this usually takes place in a standing committee in the commons and on the floor of the house in the lords. in the united kingdom the house of commons utilises the following committees on bills: standing committee despite the name a standing committee is a committee specifically constituted for a certain bill. its membership reflects the strengths of the parties in the house. it is now known as a public bill committee.[24] special standing committee the committee investigates the issues and principles of the bill before sending it to a regular standing committee. this procedure has been used very rarely in recent years (the adoption and children bill in 2001 to 2002 is the only recent example) the pre legislative scrutiny process (see above) is now preferred. this type of committee is now also known as a special public bill committee. select committee a specialised committee that normally conducts oversight hearings for a certain department considers the bill. this procedure has not been used in recent years with the exception of the quinquennial armed forces bill which is always referred to a select committee. committee of the whole house the whole house sits as a committee in the house of commons to consider a bill. bills usually considered in this way are the principal parts of the annual finance bill (the budget') bills of 1st class constitutional importance (for example the european union (withdrawal) act 2018 and bills that are so uncontroversial that the committee stage may be dispensed with quickly and easily on the floor of the house without the need to nominate a committee (some private members bills are usually dealt with this way each year). this is also the procedure used in the lords. grand committee (house of lords) this is a recent new procedure used for some bills which is intended to speed up business. although it takes place in a separate room it is technically still a committee of the whole house in that all members can attend and participate. procedure is the same as for a committee in the main chamber but there are no votes. the committee considers each clause of the bill and may make amendments to it. significant amendments may be made at committee stage. in some cases whole groups of clauses are inserted or removed. however almost all the amendments which are agreed to in committee will have been tabled by the government to correct deficiencies in the bill to enact changes to policy made since the bill was introduced (or in some cases to import material which was not ready when the bill was presented) or to reflect concessions made as a result of earlier debate. report stage[edit] the report state known formally as \"consideration\" takes place on the floor of the house and is a further opportunity to amend the bill. unlike committee stage the house need not consider every clause of the bill only those to which amendments have been tabled.3rd reading[edit] in the 3rd reading a debate on the final text of the bill as amended. in the lords further amendments may be made on 3rd reading in the commons it is usually a short debate followed by a single vote amendments are not permitted. Passage[edit] the bill is then sent to the other house (to the lords if it originated in the commons to the commons if it is a lords bill) which may amend it. the commons may reject a bill from the lords outright the lords may amend a bill from the commons but if they reject it the commons may force it through without the lords consent in the following session of parliament as is detailed below. furthermore the lords can neither initiate nor amend money bills (bills dealing exclusively with public expenditure or the raising of revenue whether a bill is a money bill is decided by the speaker of the house of commons). if the other house amends the bill the bill and amendments are sent back for a further stage. there is a constitutional convention that the house of lords should not spend more than 60 days over bills sent to them by the commons.[25] the parliament acts under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949, which do not apply for bills seeking to extend parliament's length to more than 5 years, if the lords reject a bill originated in the house of commons then the commons may pass that bill again in the next session. the bill is then submitted for royal assent even though the lords did not pass it. also if the lords do not approve of a money bill within 30 days of passage in the commons the bill is submitted for royal assent nevertheless. consideration of amendments[edit] the house in which the bill originated considers the amendments made in the other house. it may agree to them amend them propose other amendments in lieu or reject them. a bill may pass backwards and forwards several times at this stage as each house amends or rejects changes proposed by the other (a process referred to colloquially as parliamentary ping pong). if each house insists on disagreeing with the other the bill is lost under the \"double insistence\" rule unless avoiding action is taken.[26] enacting formula[edit] each act commences with 1 of the following: Standard: be it enacted by the queen's [king's] most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same as follows:-[27] for money bills: we your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects the commons of the united kingdom in parliament assembled towards raising the necessary supplies to defray your majesty's public expenses and making an addition to the public revenue have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and grant unto your majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned and do therefore most humbly beseech your majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the queen's [king's] most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same as follows: without consent of the lords under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949: be it enacted by the queen's [king's] most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the commons in this present parliament assembled in accordance with the provisions of the parliament acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same as follows: Devolution[edit] as a result of devolution the national assembly for wales the northern ireland assembly and the scottish parliament are also able to create primary legislation for their respective devolved institutions. these devolved legislatures are able to create legislation regarding all but reserved and excepted matters. however acts of the parliament of the united kingdom remain supreme and can overrule the devolved legislatures. by convention the parliament of the united kingdom does not normally do this without a legislative consent motion.[28][29][30] Sovereignty[edit] in the uk there is still a presumption that parliament is sovereign however it is recognised that acts of parliament are no longer sovereign but can be overruled if they are incompatible with european laws\".[31] within that constraint acts of parliament are generally without limit. european law can overturn such acts because the european communities act 1972 agreed that uk law should not wish to conflict with european law. however if parliament decided to it could withdraw from the european union and withdraw from all european law. parliament has also devolved significant powers to the scottish parliament the northern ireland assembly and the national assembly for wales it is free to overrule or even abolish those institutions although this would be unlikely in practice. (a recent instance when it did was the northern ireland (executive formation etc) act 2019 (which decriminalized abortion and required the secretary of state to legalize same sex marriage despite health and social policy being devolved matters) due in part to the fact that the assembly was not sitting due to ongoing political conflicts.) british law is also made through statutory instruments (sis). these are laws which are made in the name of a government minister exercising legislative powers delegated to him or her by act of parliament (known as the parent act or enabling act). some of these must be approved by parliament before they can become law others need only be laid before parliament a certain number of days (usually 40 before coming into force. they are used because they are much faster and simpler to implement than a full act of parliament and are more easily amended to reflect changing circumstances. provided they fall within the power delegated by the enabling act they have the same force as an act of parliament and much of the uk's law is made in this way. there are thousands of sis each year compared with around 50 acts.. statutory instruments are also used to bring acts into force. most acts have sections that come into effect upon royal assent or at a set date thereafter. however other sections are brought into force using an si which is titled [act name] (commencement no. #) order. whilst most legislation has had a maximum of half a dozen commencement orders this is not a strict limit as some acts have had over 10. nothing can bind parliament as a successive parliament can repeal the legislation. international treaties are not effective in domestic uk law until enforced by an act of parliament (e.g. the european communities act which brought the uk into the european union the single european act which allowed for the creation of the single european internal market or the outer space act which deals with international treaties on space). historical records[edit] at the end of a medieval parliament of england a collection of acts of a public character was made in the form of a statute roll and given the title of the king’s regnal year each particular act forming a section or a chapter of the complete statute so that e.g. the vagabonds act 1383 became vii ric. ii c.5. enrolment of public acts on manuscript parchment \"parliament rolls\" continued until 1850.[32] the longest act of parliament in the form of a scroll is an act regarding taxation passed in 1821. it is nearly a quarter of a mile 348 m) long and used to take 2 men a whole day to rewind.[33] until 1850, a paper draft was brought into the house in which the bill started after the committee stage there the bill was inscribed on a parchment roll and this parchment was then passed to the other house which could introduce amendments. the original bill was never re-written and knives were used to scrape away the script from the top surface of the rolls before the new text was added. since 1850 2 copies of each act were printed on vellum 1 for preservation in the house of lords and the other for transmission to the public record office.[34] since 1483 annual volumes of public acts (\"statute books\") have been printed. in these volumes not only public acts but also some private acts and various \"local and personal acts declared public\" have been included.[32] all uk acts of parliament since 1497 are kept in the house of lords record office including the oldest act the \"taking of apprentices for worsteads in the county of norfolk\" act 1497, a reference to the wool worstedmanufacture at worstead in norfolk england.[33] acts passed before 1 january 1963 are cited by session and chapter. the session of parliament in which the act was passed is referred to by the regnal year or years of the reigning monarch and his name which is usually abbreviated. so for example the treason act 1945 may be cited: regnal year or years monarch abbreviation of \"chapter\" chapter number8 & 9 geo 6 c 44 all acts passed on or after 1 january 1963 are cited by calendar year and chapter.[35] all recent acts have a short title or citation (e.g. local government act 2003, national health service act 1974 many acts of a private personal or local character often have not ever been printed surviving only in a single manuscript copy in the victoria tower.[36] acts in force[edit] the uk's ministry of justice publishes most acts of parliament in an online statute law database. it is the official revised edition of the primary legislation of the united kingdom. the database shows acts as amended by subsequent legislation and is the statute book of uk legislation. acts of constitutional importance[edit] important acts in uk constitutional history include: magna carta - first law to limit the powers of the monarch treason act 1351 - codified the existing common law relating to treason. succession to the crown act 1533 - altered the succession by declaring henry viii is 1st daughter mary ineligible to the throne. laws in wales acts 1535 to 1542 -

united the kingdoms of great britain and ireland into the united kingdom of great britain and ireland reform act 1832 - with later reform acts and representation of the people acts made election to the house of commons uniform abolished the undemocratic rotten boroughs and created new constituencies for newly populous industrial cities such as birmingham parliament act 1911 (amended 1949 -

        "formatted": "ACT OF PARLIAMENT (UK)\n\n In the United Kingdom an Act of Parliament is primary legislation passed by the Parliament of the\nUnited Kingdom.[1][2] As a result of the Glorious Revolution and the assertion of parliamentary\nsovereignty, any such Act is in theory supreme law that cannot be overturned by any body other than\nParliament, although it has been recognised through the United Kingdom's membership of the European\nUnion that Acts or parts of Acts which conflict with EU law can be disapplied.\n\nAn Act of Parliament can be enforced in all four of the UK constituent countries (England, Scotland, \nWales and Northern Ireland); however as a result of devolution the majority of Acts that are now\npassed by Parliament apply either to England and Wales only, or England only; whilst generally Acts\nonly relating to constitutional and reserved matters now apply to the whole of the United Kingdom.\n\nA draft piece of legislation is called a Bill; when this is passed by Parliament and given Royal\nAssent, it becomes an Act and part of statute law.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF LEGISLATION[EDIT]\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Parliamentary_archives.jpg/261px-Parliamentary_archives.jpg]\n \n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/150px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png]\n \n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/150px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png]\n Acts of Parliament are classified as either \"Public General Acts\" or \"Local and Personal Acts\"\n(also known as \"Private Acts\"). Bills are also classified as \"public\", \"private\", or \"hybrid\".\n\nPUBLIC GENERAL ACTS[EDIT]\nPublic General Acts form the largest category of legislation, in principle affecting the public\ngeneral law applying to everyone across the entire United Kingdom (or at least to one or more of its\nconstituent countries of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, or Wales).[3] Most Public General Acts\nproceed through Parliament as a public bill; occasionally, however, a bill is treated as hybrid.\n\nLOCAL AND PERSONAL ACTS (PRIVATE ACTS)[EDIT]\nPrivate Acts are either local or personal in their effect, applying to a specifically named locality\nor legal person in a manner different from all others. Private bills are \"usually promoted by\norganisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in\nconflict with, the general law. Private bills only change the law as it applies to specific\nindividuals or organisations, rather than the general public. Groups or individuals potentially\naffected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed bill and present their\nobjections to committees of MPs and Lords.\"[4] They include acts to confer powers on certain local\nauthorities, a recent example being the Canterbury City Council Bill, which makes provisions\nrelating to street trading and consumer protection in the city.[4] Private bills can also affect\ncertain companies: the Northern Bank Bill allowed the statutory right of Northern Bank to issue bank\nnotes to be transferred to Danske Bank which had acquired it.[5]Other private bills may affect\nparticular companies established by Act of Parliament such as TSB Bank and Transas.\n\nPersonal Acts are a sub-category of private Acts, which confer specific rights or duties on a named\nindividual or individuals, for example allowing two persons to marry even though they are within a\n\"prohibited degree of consanguinity or affinity\" such as stepfather and stepdaughter.\n\nPrivate bills, common in the 19th century, are now rare, as new planning legislation introduced in\nthe 1960s removed the need for many of them;[6] only a few, if any, are passed each year.\n\nParliamentary authorities maintain a list of all private bills before parliament.\n\nHYBRID BILLS[EDIT]\nHybrid bills combine elements of both public and private bill. While they propose to make changes to\nthe general law, they also contain provisions applying to specific individuals or bodies. Recent\nexamples are the Crossrail Bill, a hybrid bill to build a railway across London from west to east,\n[7]and the 1976 Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, which was a particularly controversial\nbill that was ruled to be a hybrid bill, forcing the government to withdraw some of its provisions\nto allow its passage as a public bill. Once passed, hybrid bills are printed as part of the Public\nGeneral Acts.\n\nParliamentary authorities maintain a list of all hybrid bills before parliament.\n\nOTHER TYPES OF CLASSIFICATION[EDIT]\nPRIVATE MEMBERS' BILLS[EDIT]\nIt is important not to confuse private bills with private members' bills, which are public bills\nintended to effect a general change in the law. The only difference from other public bills is that\nthey are brought forward by a private member (a backbencher) rather than by the government.[8] \nTwenty private members' bills per session are allowed to be introduced, with the sponsoring private\nmembers selected by a ballot of the whole house, and additional bills may be introduced under the \nTen Minute Rule.\n\nFINANCIAL BILLS[EDIT]\nFinancial bills raise revenue and authorise how money is spent. The best-known such bills are the\n(normally annual) Finance Bills introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget. This\nusually encompasses all the changes to be made to tax law for the year. Its formal description is \"a\nBill to grant certain duties, to alter other duties, and to amend the law relating to the National\nDebt and the Public Revenue, and to make further provision in connection with finance\".[9]\nConsolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills authorise government spending.[10]\n\nHOUSEKEEPING BILLS[EDIT]\nThis type of bill is designed to keep the business of government and public affairs up to date.\nThese bills may not be substantial or controversial in party political terms. Two sub-classes of the\nhousekeeping bill are consolidation bills, which set out existing law in a clearer and more\nup-to-date form without changing its substance; and the tax law rewrite bills[are there enough of\nthese to constitute a class?], which do the same for tax law.[10]\n\nDELEGATED LEGISLATION[EDIT]\nAn Act of Parliament will often confer power on the Queen in Council, a Minister, or another public\nbody to create delegated legislation, usually by means of a Statutory Instrument.\n\nSTAGES OF A BILL[EDIT]\n[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Legislative_procedure_uk.svg/300px-Legislative_procedure_uk.svg.png]\n A representation of the legislative procedure. Bills may start their passage in either the House of Commons or House of Lords, although bills which\nare mainly or entirely financial will start in the Commons. Each bill passes through the following\nstages:\n\nCONSULTATION, DRAFTING AND PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY[EDIT]\nAlthough not strictly part of the legislative process, a period of consultation will take place\nbefore a bill is drafted. Within government, the Treasury and other departments with an interest\nwill be consulted along with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nOutside government, interested parties such as trade unions, industry bodies and pressure groups\nwill be asked for their views on any proposals. The Cabinet Office Code of Practice specifies a\nminimum consultation period of twelve weeks. Consultation documents are widely circulated (see for\nexample the Home Officeconsultation on extreme pornography[permanent dead link] and the Scottish\nGovernment's consultation on food policy).\n\nThe character of the consultation is shaped by the government's determination to press forward with\na particular set of proposals. A government may publish a green paper outlining various legislative\noptions or a white paper, which is a clear statement of intent.[11] It is increasingly common for a\nsmall number of Government bills to be published in draft before they are presented in Parliament.\nThese bills are then considered either by the relevant select committee of the House of Commons or\nby an ad hoc joint committee of both Houses. This provides an opportunity for the committee to\nexpress a view on the bill and propose amendments before it is introduced. Draft bills allow more\nlengthy scrutiny of potential legislation and have been seen as a response to time pressures which\nmay result in the use of programme orders to impose a strict timetable on the passage of bills and\nwhat is known as 'drafting on the hoof', where the government introduces amendments to its own\nbills. With increased time for scrutiny backed up with considered evidence, draft bills may present\ngovernments with difficulty in getting their way.[12]\n\nThe sponsoring government department will then write to the relevant policy committee of the\nCabinet. The proposals are only discussed at a meeting if disagreements arise. Even an\nuncontroversial proposal may face administrative hurdles. A potential change in the law may have to\nwait for a more extensive bill in that policy area to be brought forward before it is worthwhile\ndevoting parliamentary time to it. The proposal will then be bundled together with more substantive\nmeasures in the same Bill. The Ministerial Committee on the Legislative Programme (LP), including\nthe leaders and government chief whips in both houses, is responsible for the timetable of\nlegislation. This committee decides which house a bill will start in, recommends to the Cabinet\nwhich proposals will be in the Queen's Speech, which will be published in draft and how much\nparliamentary time will be required.[11]\n\nFollowing a process of consultation, the sponsoring department will send drafting instructions to\nparliamentary counsel, expert lawyers working for the government responsible for writing\nlegislation. These instructions will describe what the bill should do but not the detail of how this\nis achieved. The Parliamentary counsel must draft the legislation clearly to minimise the\npossibility of legal challenge and to fit the bill in with existing UK, European Union and delegated\nlegislation. A finished bill must be approved or scrutinised by the sponsoring department and\nminister, parliamentary counsel and LP.[13]\n\nThe final stage is the submission of the bill to the authorities of the House in which it is to\nstart its legislative journey. In the Commons, this is the Clerk of Legislation and the Public Bill\nOffice in the Lords. They will check the following:[14]\n\n * That the bill complies with the rules of the house\n * That everything in the bill is covered by its 'long title' (text describing the purposes of the\n   bill)\n * In the Commons, that every provision requiring expenditure or levying taxes is identified and\n   printed in italics\n * Whether the Royal Prerogative is affected\n * Whether it conflicts with or duplicates any bill which has already been introduced\n\nAfter this process, the bill is then ready for introduction.\n\nFIRST READING[EDIT]\nThe first reading is a formality and no debate or vote occurs. A notice that a bill is being\npresented for its first reading appears on the Order Paper for that day. The European Union\n(Amendment) Bill appeared on the Order Paper for 17 December 2007 as follows:\n\nNotice of Presentation of Bill\n\n1 EUROPEAN UNION (AMENDMENT) [No debate]\n\nSecretary David Miliband\n\nBill to make provision in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union\nand the Treaty Establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007.\n\nFormal first reading: no debate or decision.[15]\n\nAs we can see in this video footage of the first reading, the MP is called by the Speaker at the\ncommencement of public business and brings a 'dummy bill', a sheet of paper with the short and long\ntitles and the names of up to twelve supporters, to the Clerk of the House at the Table. The Clerk\nreads out the short title and the Speaker says \"Second reading what day?\" For all government bills,\nthe response is almost always \"tomorrow\" (or the next sitting day). A date is also set for private\nmembers bills; the decision for scheduling such bills is crucial as they are not given 'government\ntime' to be debated. The bill is recorded in the proceedings as having been read for a first time,\nhaving been ordered to be printed and to be read a second time on a particular date.[16] In the case\nof a Government Bill, Explanatory Notes, which try to explain the effect of the Bill in more simple\nlanguage, are also usually ordered to be printed. Again, in the case of the European Union\n(Amendment) Bill this appeared in Hansard as follows:\n\nSecretary David Miliband, supported by the Prime Minister, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.\nSecretary Straw, Secretary Jacqui Smith, Secretary Des Browne, Secretary Alan Johnson, Mr. Secretary\nAlexander, Mr. Secretary Hutton and Mr. Jim Murphy, presented a Bill to make provision in connection\nwith the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the\nEuropean Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007: And the same was read the First time,\nordered to be read a Second time tomorrow, and to be printed. Explanatory notes to be printed [Bill\n48].\n\nA bill introduced in this way is known as a presentation bill. Bills can also be introduced in the\nCommons by being brought in from the Lords, being brought in by resolution (like the Finance Bill)\nor when an MP gets leave to bring in a ten-minute rule bill.\n\nA Government Bill can be introduced first into either House. Bills which begin in the Lords have\n'[Lords]' suffixed to its title when in the Lords and '[HL]' when in the Commons.[8] Bills which\ndeal primarily with taxation or public expenditure begin their passage in the Commons since the\nfinancial privileges of that House mean that it has primacy in these matters (see Parliament Acts\n1911 and 1949). Conversely, bills relating to the judicial system, Law Commission bills and \nconsolidation bills begin their passage in the House of Lords which by convention has primacy in\nthese matters.\n\nSECOND READING[EDIT]\nIn the second reading, which in theory is supposed to occur two weekends after the first reading, a\ndebate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote. This is the main opportunity to\ndebate the principle of the bill rather than individual clauses. A division at this stage,\ntherefore, represents a direct challenge to the principle of the bill. If the bill is read a second\ntime, it proceeds to the committee stage.\n\nNormally, the Second Reading of a Government bill is approved. A defeat for a Government bill on\nthis Reading usually signifies a major loss. The last time this happened was at the second reading\nof the Shops Bill for the government of Margaret Thatcher in 1986. The bill, which liberalised\ncontrols on Sunday trading, was defeated in the Commons by 14 votes.[17][18]\n\nSecond reading debates on government bills usually take a day, in practice about six hours. Smaller\nand less controversial bills will receive less time and wholly uncontroversial measures will receive\na second reading 'on the nod' with no debate whatsoever.[19] The National Insurance Contributions\nbill appeared in the Order Papers as follows:\n\nMain Business\n\n3 NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BILL: Second Reading. [Until 10.00 p.m.]\n\nDebate may continue until 10.00 p.m.\n\nAs we can see from video footage of the debate for this bill, second readings of government bills\ntake place on a motion moved (for Government bills) by a minister in the department responsible for\nthe legislation \"that the bill now be read a second time\". The minister outlines the overall purpose\nof the Bill and highlights particular parts of the Bill they consider most important. The official\nOpposition spokesperson responds with his or her views on the Bill. The debate continues with other\nOpposition parties and backbench MPs giving their opinions on the principles of the Bill.[20] The\nminister will eventually bring the debate to a conclusion by saying, of the bill, \"I commend it to\nthe House\". The Speaker will then put the question by saying, for example, \"The Question is, that\nthe Bill be now read a second time\". The Speaker then invites supporters of the bill to say \"aye\"\nand then opponents say \"no\": first he says, \"All members of that opinion say 'aye'\", and supporters\nsay 'aye'; then the speaker says \"contrary 'no'\", and opponents say 'no'. In what is known as \ncollecting the voices the Speaker makes a judgement as to the loudest cry. A clear majority, either\nway, will prompt the response \"I think the Ayes/Noes have it\" (this can be forced to a division by\ncontinued cries either way). If the result is at all in doubt a division will be called and the\nSpeaker will say \"Division. Clear the Lobby\". This refers not to the division lobbies used for\nvoting but the Members' Lobby beyond the chamber which is cleared by the doorkeepers. At this point, \ndivision bells will ring throughout the palace and also in nearby flats, pubs and restaurants whose\nowners pay to be connected to the system. This allows MPs who may not be in the debate to come and\nvote on the issue in question.\n\nAfter two minutes, the Speaker will put the Question again to assess whether there is still\ndisagreement. He will then name the tellers, whose job it is to count the votes. These will usually\nbe government and opposition whips. In the example we have looked at: \"Tellers for the Ayes Mr. Dave\nWatts and Mr. Steve McCabe; tellers for the Noes Mr. Nick Hurd and Mr. John Baron\". If no teller has\ncome forward (or only one) the Speaker declares the result for the other side.\n\nOne teller from each side goes to the end of each division lobby and they count MPs as they emerge.\nWhips are also at the other end of the lobby to try to ensure that their MPs vote with the party\nline. The names are taken by division clerks and are published in Hansard the next day (see example\nfrom Hansard or with greater clarity from the Public Whip). Eight minutes after first calling the\ndivision, the Speaker says \"lock the doors\"; the doorkeepers lock the doors leading into the lobbies\nand no more MPs can get in to vote. When every member has passed the division clerks and tellers, a \ndivision slip is produced by the Clerks at the Table and is given to one of the tellers on the\nwinning side. The tellers then form up at the Table in front of the Mace facing the Speaker, and the\nteller with the slip reads the result to the House, for example: \"The Ayes to the right, 291. The\nNoes to the left, 161\". The Clerk then takes the slip to the Speaker, who repeats the result and\nadds \"So the Ayes have it, the Ayes have it. Unlock.\" The doorkeepers then unlock the doors to the\ndivision lobbies.[21] A division vote concerning a National Insurance Contributions Bill is\nillustrated from Hansard as follows:\n\nQuestion put, That the Bill be now read a Second time:—\n\nThe House divided: Ayes 291, Noes 161.\n\nDivision No. 033\n\n7.56 pm\n\nAYES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted Aye]\n\nNOES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted No]\n\nQuestion accordingly agreed to.\n\nBill read a Second time.[22]\n\nDivisions on second readings can be on a straight opposition or a vote on a 'reasoned amendment',\ndetailing the reasons the bill's opponents do not want it read a second time, which may be selected\nby the Speaker. Bills defeated at a second reading cannot progress further or be reintroduced with\nexactly the same wording in the same session.\n\nPROCEDURAL ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS[EDIT]\nIn the case of Government Bills, the House normally passes forthwith (i.e. without debate but almost\nalways with a vote) a Programme Order in the form of a programme motion, setting out the timetable\nfor the committee and remaining stages of the Bill. This takes place immediately after the second\nreading.[17] For example:\n\n National Insurance Contributions Bill (Programme) \nMotion made, and Question put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 83A (Programme motions), \nThat the following provisions shall apply to the National Insurance Contributions Bill: \nCommittal \n1. The Bill shall be committed to a Public Bill Committee. \nProceedings in Public Bill Committee. \n2. Proceedings in the Public Bill Committee shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to\na conclusion on 22nd January 2008. \n3. The Public Bill Committee shall have leave to sit twice on the first day on which it meets. \nConsideration and Third Reading \n4. Proceedings on consideration shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a\nconclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which those proceedings are\ncommenced. \n5. Proceedings on Third Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a\nconclusion at the moment of interruption on that day. \n6. Standing Order No. 83B (Programming committees) shall not apply to proceedings on consideration\nand Third Reading. \nOther proceedings \n7. Any other proceedings on the Bill (including any proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments\nor on any further messages from the Lords) may be programmed. —[Tony Cunningham.] \nQuestion agreed to.[23] \n\nThe House may also pass a separate money resolution, authorising any expenditure arising from the\nBill; and/or a ways and means resolution, authorising any new taxes or charges the Bill creates.\nBills are not programmed in the House of Lords.[17]\n\nCOMMITTEE STAGE[EDIT]\nThis usually takes place in a standing committee in the Commons and on the Floor of the House in the\nLords. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons utilises the following committees on bills:\n\n * Standing Committee: Despite the name, a standing committee is a committee specifically\n   constituted for a certain bill. Its membership reflects the strengths of the parties in the\n   House. It is now known as a Public Bill Committee.[24]\n * Special Standing Committee: The committee investigates the issues and principles of the bill\n   before sending it to a regular Standing Committee. This procedure has been used very rarely in\n   recent years (the Adoption and Children Bill in 2001–2002 is the only recent example); the pre-\n   legislative scrutiny process (see above) is now preferred. This type of committee is now also\n   known as a Special Public Bill Committee.\n * Select Committee: A specialised committee that normally conducts oversight hearings for a certain\n   Department considers the bill. This procedure has not been used in recent years, with the\n   exception of the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill, which is always referred to a select committee.\n * Committee of the Whole House: The whole house sits as a committee in the House of Commons to\n   consider a bill. Bills usually considered in this way are the principal parts of the annual \n   Finance Bill (the 'budget'), bills of first-class constitutional importance (for example, the \n   European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018), and bills that are so uncontroversial that the committee\n   stage may be dispensed with quickly and easily on the floor of the House, without the need to\n   nominate a committee (some Private Members' Bills are usually dealt with this way each year).\n   This is also the procedure used in the Lords.\n * Grand Committee (House of Lords): This is a recent new procedure used for some bills which is\n   intended to speed up business. Although it takes place in a separate room, it is technically\n   still a committee of the whole House in that all members can attend and participate. Procedure is\n   the same as for a Committee in the main Chamber, but there are no votes.\n\nThe committee considers each clause of the bill and may make amendments to it. Significant\namendments may be made at committee stage. In some cases, whole groups of clauses are inserted or\nremoved. However, almost all the amendments which are agreed to in committee will have been tabled\nby the Government to correct deficiencies in the bill, to enact changes to policy made since the\nbill was introduced (or, in some cases, to import material which was not ready when the bill was\npresented), or to reflect concessions made as a result of earlier debate.\n\nREPORT STAGE[EDIT]\nThe report state, known formally as \"consideration\", takes place on the Floor of the House, and is a\nfurther opportunity to amend the bill. Unlike committee stage, the House need not consider every\nclause of the bill, only those to which amendments have been tabled.\n\nTHIRD READING[EDIT]\nIn the third reading, a debate on the final text of the bill, as amended. In the Lords, further\namendments may be made on third reading, in the Commons, it is usually a short debate followed by a\nsingle vote; amendments are not permitted.\n\nPASSAGE[EDIT]\nThe bill is then sent to the other House (to the Lords, if it originated in the Commons; to the\nCommons if it is a Lords bill), which may amend it. The Commons may reject a bill from the Lords\noutright; the Lords may amend a bill from the Commons but, if they reject it, the Commons may force\nit through without the Lords' consent in the following Session of Parliament, as is detailed below.\nFurthermore, the Lords can neither initiate nor amend money bills (bills dealing exclusively with\npublic expenditure or the raising of revenue; whether a bill is a money bill is decided by the\nSpeaker of the House of Commons). If the other House amends the bill, the bill and amendments are\nsent back for a further stage.\n\nThere is a constitutional convention that the House of Lords should not spend more than 60 days over\nbills sent to them by the Commons.[25]\n\nThe Parliament Acts: Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, which do not apply for bills seeking\nto extend Parliament's length to more than five years, if the Lords reject a bill originated in the\nHouse of Commons, then the Commons may pass that bill again in the next session. The bill is then\nsubmitted for Royal Assent even though the Lords did not pass it. Also, if the Lords do not approve\nof a money bill within thirty days of passage in the Commons, the bill is submitted for Royal Assent\nnevertheless.\n\nCONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS[EDIT]\nThe House in which the bill originated considers the amendments made in the other House. It may\nagree to them, amend them, propose other amendments in lieu or reject them. A bill may pass\nbackwards and forwards several times at this stage, as each House amends or rejects changes proposed\nby the other (a process referred to colloquially as parliamentary ping-pong). If each House insists\non disagreeing with the other, the bill is lost under the 'double insistence' rule, unless avoiding\naction is taken.[26]\n\nENACTING FORMULA[EDIT]\nEach Act commences with one of the following:\n\nStandard:\n\nBe it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of\nthe Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the\nauthority of the same, as follows:-[27]\n\nFor money bills:\n\nWe, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament\nassembled, towards raising the necessary supplies to defray Your Majesty's public expenses, and\nmaking an addition to the public revenue, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and grant\nunto Your Majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech\nYour Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent\nMajesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in\nthis present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-\n\nWithout consent of the Lords, under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949:\n\nBE IT ENACTED by The Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of\nthe Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the\nParliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-\n\nDEVOLUTION[EDIT]\nAs a result of devolution, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the \nScottish Parliament are also able to create primary legislation for their respective devolved\ninstitutions. These devolved legislatures are able to create legislation regarding all but reserved\nand excepted matters. However, Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom remain supreme and can\noverrule the devolved legislatures. By convention, the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not\nnormally do this without a legislative consent motion.[28][29][30]\n\nSOVEREIGNTY[EDIT]\nIn the UK there is still a presumption that Parliament is sovereign; however, it is recognised that\n\"Acts of Parliament are no longer sovereign but can be overruled if they are incompatible with \nEuropean Laws\".[31] Within that constraint Acts of Parliament are generally without limit. European\nlaw can overturn such Acts because the European Communities Act 1972 agreed that UK law should not\nwish to conflict with European Law. However, if Parliament decided to, it could withdraw from the\nEuropean Union and withdraw from all European law. Parliament has also devolved significant powers\nto the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the National Assembly for Wales, it is\nfree to overrule or even abolish those institutions, although this would be unlikely in practice. (A\nrecent instance when it did was the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 (which\ndecriminalized abortion and required the Secretary of State to legalize same-sex marriage despite\nhealth and social policy being devolved matters), due in part to the fact that the Assembly was not\nsitting due to ongoing political conflicts.)\n\nBritish law is also made through Statutory Instruments (SIs). These are laws which are made in the\nname of a government minister, exercising legislative powers delegated to him or her by Act of\nParliament (known as the parent Act or enabling Act). Some of these must be approved by Parliament\nbefore they can become law, others need only be laid before Parliament a certain number of days\n(usually 40) before coming into force. They are used because they are much faster and simpler to\nimplement than a full Act of Parliament, and are more easily amended to reflect changing\ncircumstances. Provided they fall within the power delegated by the enabling Act, they have the same\nforce as an Act of Parliament, and much of the UK's law is made in this way. There are thousands of\nSIs each year, compared with around 50 Acts. Statutory Instruments are also used to bring Acts into\nforce. Most Acts have sections that come into effect upon Royal Assent, or at a set date thereafter.\nHowever, other sections are brought into force using an SI which is titled [Act Name] (Commencement\nNo. #) Order. Whilst most legislation has had a maximum of half a dozen Commencement Orders, this is\nnot a strict limit as some Acts have had over 10.\n\nNothing can bind Parliament as a successive parliament can repeal the legislation.\n\nInternational treaties are not effective in domestic UK law until enforced by an Act of Parliament\n(e.g. The European Communities Act, which brought the UK into the European Union, the Single\nEuropean Act which allowed for the creation of the single European internal market or the Outer\nSpace Act which deals with international treaties on Space).\n\nHISTORICAL RECORDS[EDIT]\nAt the end of a medieval Parliament of England a collection of Acts of a public character was made\nin the form of a Statute Roll and given the title of the King’s regnal year; each particular Act\nforming a section, or a chapter, of the complete Statute, so that, e.g. the Vagabonds Act 1383 \nbecame VII Ric. II, c.5. Enrolment of Public Acts on manuscript parchment \"Parliament Rolls\"\ncontinued until 1850.[32] The longest Act of Parliament in the form of a scroll is an Act regarding\ntaxation passed in 1821. It is nearly a quarter of a mile (348 m) long, and used to take two men a\nwhole day to rewind.[33] Until 1850, a paper draft was brought into the House in which the Bill\nstarted; after the committee stage there the Bill was inscribed on a parchment roll and this\nparchment was then passed to the other House which could introduce amendments. The original Bill was\nnever re-written and knives were used to scrape away the script from the top surface of the rolls\nbefore the new text was added. Since 1850 two copies of each Act were printed on vellum, one for\npreservation in the House of Lords and the other for transmission to the Public Record Office.[34]\n\nSince 1483 annual volumes of Public Acts (\"Statute Books\") have been printed. In these volumes not\nonly Public Acts but also some Private Acts and various \"Local and Personal Acts declared Public\"\nhave been included.[32]\n\nAll UK Acts of Parliament since 1497 are kept in the House of Lords Record Office, including the\noldest Act: The \"Taking of Apprentices for Worsteads in the County of Norfolk\" Act 1497, a reference\nto the wool worstedmanufacture at Worstead in Norfolk, England.[33]\n\nActs passed before 1 January 1963 are cited by session and chapter. The session of parliament in\nwhich the Act was passed is referred to by the regnal year or years of the reigning Monarch and his\nname, which is usually abbreviated. So, for example, the Treason Act 1945 may be cited:\n\nREGNAL YEAR OR YEARS   MONARCH   ABBREVIATION OF \"CHAPTER\"   CHAPTER NUMBER   \n8 & 9                  Geo 6     c                           44               \n\nAll Acts passed on or after 1 January 1963 are cited by calendar year and chapter.[35]\n\nAll recent Acts have a short title, or citation (e.g. Local Government Act 2003, National Health\nService Act 1974).\n\nMany Acts of a private, personal or local character often have not ever been printed, surviving only\nin a single manuscript copy in the Victoria Tower.[36]\n\nACTS IN FORCE[EDIT]\nThe UK's Ministry of Justice publishes most Acts of Parliament in an online statute law database. It\nis the official revised edition of the primary legislation of the United Kingdom. The database shows\nActs as amended by subsequent legislation and is the statute book of UK legislation.\n\nACTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE[EDIT]\nImportant acts in UK constitutional history include:\n\n * Magna Carta – first law to limit the powers of the Monarch\n * Treason Act 1351 – codified the existing common law relating to treason.\n * Succession to the Crown Act 1533 – altered the succession by declaring Henry VIII's first\n   daughter Mary ineligible to the throne.\n * Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 – annexed Wales to England.\n * Succession to the Crown Act 1536 – removed both of Henry VIII's daughters (Mary and Elizabeth)\n   from being eligible to the throne.\n * Crown of Ireland Act 1542 – created the office of King of Ireland.\n * Succession to the Crown Act 1543 – Reinstated both of Henry VIII's daughters in the line of\n   succession behind his son, establishing the principle of male-preference primogeniture.\n * Petition of Right (1628) – sets out specific liberties which the Monarch was prohibited from\n   infringing.\n * Habeas Corpus Act 1679 – forced courts to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention.\n * Bill of Rights 1689 – placed (or restated) limits on the monarch's power, formalising \n   constitutional monarchy.\n * Act of Settlement 1701 – established the line of succession for the monarchy through the\n   Protestant Sophia, Electress of Hanover, disinheriting all Catholics and those who married\n   Catholics.\n * Act of Union 1707 – united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into Great Britain, abolishing\n   the Parliament of Scotland\n * Act of Union 1800 – united the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of\n   Great Britain and Ireland\n * Reform Act 1832 – with later Reform Acts and Representation of the People Acts, made election to\n   the House of Commons uniform, abolished the undemocratic rotten boroughs, and created new\n   constituencies for newly populous industrial cities such as Birmingham\n * Parliament Act 1911 (amended 1949) – allowed the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords\n   after a delay\n * Welsh Church Act 1914 (in force 1920) – disestablished the state church in Wales, creating the \n   Church in Wales\n * Representation of the People Act 1918 (amended 1928) – extended the right to vote to women\n * Statute of Westminster 1931 – gave constitutional independence to the British dominions overseas.\n   Numerous powers of legislative and judicial dependency remained; several more Acts have\n   restricted or abolished these powers, for example the Canada Act 1982.\n * His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 – passed the abdication of King Edward VIII into\n   law\n * Ireland Act 1949 – formally recognised the modern Republic of Ireland by the United Kingdom and\n   abolished the monarchy in Ireland outside of Northern Ireland\n * European Communities Act 1972 – made the UK part of what is now the European Union providing for\n   the application of European law\n * Human Rights Act 1998 – enshrined the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law,\n   affecting government decision making, interpretation of law, and appeals\n * House of Lords Act 1999 – removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of\n   Lords, leaving 92 seats reserved for hereditary peers to be filled by election by other eligible\n   lords\n * Northern Ireland Act 1998 – established a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and passed the Good\n   Friday Agreement into law\n * Scotland Act 1998 – established a devolved Scottish Parliament\n * Government of Wales Act 1998 – created a devolved National Assembly for Wales\n * Greater London Authority Act 1999 – established an elected Mayor of London and an assembly for\n   Greater London\n * Constitutional Reform Act 2005 - established the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and reformed\n   the office of Lord Chancellor\n * Government of Wales Act 2006 – conferred additional law-making powers to the National Assembly\n   for Wales\n * Northern Ireland Act 2009 – devolved policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly,\n   averting the assembly from being abolished\n * Scotland Act 2012 – conferred additional powers to the Scottish Parliament\n * Succession to the Crown Act 2013 – established absolute progenitor primogeniture in succession to\n   the Crown (abolishing male preference), and removed disqualification from those who marry\n   Catholics, implementing the Perth Agreementbetween countries sharing the UK's monarch\n * Wales Act 2017 – changed Welsh devolution to the reserved powers model\n * European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 – enables transposition of EU law into UK law, repeals the\n   European Communities Act 1972, and specifies processes and deadlines for ratifying a withdrawal\n   agreement\n\nSEE ALSO[EDIT]\nFURTHER READING[EDIT]\nREFERENCES[EDIT]\n 1.   ^ Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42).

Bills are also classified as \"public\", \"private\", or \"hybrid\".</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>PUBLIC GENERAL ACTS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Public General Acts form the largest category of legislation, in principle affecting the public</span>\n<span>general law applying to everyone across the entire United Kingdom (or at least to one or more of its</span>\n<span>constituent countries of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, or Wales).[3] Most Public General Acts</span>\n<span>proceed through Parliament as a public bill; occasionally, however, a bill is treated as hybrid.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>LOCAL AND PERSONAL ACTS (PRIVATE ACTS)[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Private Acts are either local or personal in their effect, applying to a specifically named locality</span>\n<span>or legal person in a manner different from all others. Private bills are \"usually promoted by</span>\n<span>organisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in</span>\n<span>conflict with, the general law. Private bills only change the law as it applies to specific</span>\n<span>individuals or organisations, rather than the general public. Groups or individuals potentially</span>\n<span>affected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed bill and present their</span>\n<span>objections to committees of MPs and Lords.\"[4] They include acts to confer powers on certain local</span>\n<span>authorities, a recent example being the Canterbury City Council Bill, which makes provisions</span>\n<span>relating to street trading and consumer protection in the city.[4] Private bills can also affect</span>\n<span>certain companies: the Northern Bank Bill allowed the statutory right of Northern Bank to issue bank</span>\n<span>notes to be transferred to Danske Bank which had acquired it.[5]Other private bills may affect</span>\n<span>particular companies established by Act of Parliament such as TSB Bank and Transas.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Personal Acts are a sub-category of private Acts, which confer specific rights or duties on a named</span>\n<span>individual or individuals, for example allowing two persons to marry even though they are within a</span>\n<span>\"prohibited degree of consanguinity or affinity\" such as stepfather and stepdaughter.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Private bills, common in the 19th century, are now rare, as new planning legislation introduced in</span>\n<span>the 1960s removed the need for many of them;[6] only a few, if any, are passed each year.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Parliamentary authorities maintain a list of all private bills before parliament.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>HYBRID BILLS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Hybrid bills combine elements of both public and private bill. While they propose to make changes to</span>\n<span>the general law, they also contain provisions applying to specific individuals or bodies. Recent</span>\n<span>examples are the Crossrail Bill, a hybrid bill to build a railway across London from west to east,</span>\n<span>[7]and the 1976 Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, which was a particularly controversial</span>\n<span>bill that was ruled to be a hybrid bill, forcing the government to withdraw some of its provisions</span>\n<span>to allow its passage as a public bill. Once passed, hybrid bills are printed as part of the Public</span>\n<span>General Acts.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Parliamentary authorities maintain a list of all hybrid bills before parliament.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>OTHER TYPES OF CLASSIFICATION[EDIT]</span>\n<span>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BILLS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>It is important not to confuse private bills with private members' bills, which are public bills</span>\n<span>intended to effect a general change in the law. The only difference from other public bills is that</span>\n<span>they are brought forward by a private member (a backbencher) rather than by the government.[8] </span>\n<span>Twenty private members' bills per session are allowed to be introduced, with the sponsoring private</span>\n<span>members selected by a ballot of the whole house, and additional bills may be introduced under the </span>\n<span>Ten Minute Rule.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>FINANCIAL BILLS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Financial bills raise revenue and authorise how money is spent. The best-known such bills are the</span>\n<span>(normally annual) Finance Bills introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget. This</span>\n<span>usually encompasses all the changes to be made to tax law for the year. Its formal description is \"a</span>\n<span>Bill to grant certain duties, to alter other duties, and to amend the law relating to the National</span>\n<span>Debt and the Public Revenue, and to make further provision in connection with finance\".[9]</span>\n<span>Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills authorise government spending.[10]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>HOUSEKEEPING BILLS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>This type of bill is designed to keep the business of government and public affairs up to date.</span>\n<span>These bills may not be substantial or controversial in party political terms. Two sub-classes of the</span>\n<span>housekeeping bill are consolidation bills, which set out existing law in a clearer and more</span>\n<span>up-to-date form without changing its substance; and the tax law rewrite bills[are there enough of</span>\n<span>these to constitute a class?], which do the same for tax law.[10]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>DELEGATED LEGISLATION[EDIT]</span>\n<span>An Act of Parliament will often confer power on the Queen in Council, a Minister, or another public</span>\n<span>body to create delegated legislation, usually by means of a Statutory Instrument.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>STAGES OF A BILL[EDIT]</span>\n<span>[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Legislative_procedure_uk.svg/300px-Legislative_procedure_uk.svg.png]</span>\n<span> A representation of the legislative procedure. Bills may start their passage in either the House of Commons or House of Lords, although bills which</span>\n<span>are mainly or entirely financial will start in the Commons. Each bill passes through the following</span>\n<span>stages:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>CONSULTATION, DRAFTING AND PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Although not strictly part of the legislative process, a period of consultation will take place</span>\n<span>before a bill is drafted. Within government, the Treasury and other departments with an interest</span>\n<span>will be consulted along with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</span>\n<span>Outside government, interested parties such as trade unions, industry bodies and pressure groups</span>\n<span>will be asked for their views on any proposals. The Cabinet Office Code of Practice specifies a</span>\n<span>minimum consultation period of twelve weeks. Consultation documents are widely circulated (see for</span>\n<span>example the Home Officeconsultation on extreme pornography[permanent dead link] and the Scottish</span>\n<span>Government's consultation on food policy).</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The character of the consultation is shaped by the government's determination to press forward with</span>\n<span>a particular set of proposals. A government may publish a green paper outlining various legislative</span>\n<span>options or a white paper, which is a clear statement of intent.[11] It is increasingly common for a</span>\n<span>small number of Government bills to be published in draft before they are presented in Parliament.</span>\n<span>These bills are then considered either by the relevant select committee of the House of Commons or</span>\n<span>by an ad hoc joint committee of both Houses. This provides an opportunity for the committee to</span>\n<span>express a view on the bill and propose amendments before it is introduced. Draft bills allow more</span>\n<span>lengthy scrutiny of potential legislation and have been seen as a response to time pressures which</span>\n<span>may result in the use of programme orders to impose a strict timetable on the passage of bills and</span>\n<span>what is known as 'drafting on the hoof', where the government introduces amendments to its own</span>\n<span>bills. With increased time for scrutiny backed up with considered evidence, draft bills may present</span>\n<span>governments with difficulty in getting their way.[12]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The sponsoring government department will then write to the relevant policy committee of the</span>\n<span>Cabinet. The proposals are only discussed at a meeting if disagreements arise. Even an</span>\n<span>uncontroversial proposal may face administrative hurdles. A potential change in the law may have to</span>\n<span>wait for a more extensive bill in that policy area to be brought forward before it is worthwhile</span>\n<span>devoting parliamentary time to it. The proposal will then be bundled together with more substantive</span>\n<span>measures in the same Bill. The Ministerial Committee on the Legislative Programme (LP), including</span>\n<span>the leaders and government chief whips in both houses, is responsible for the timetable of</span>\n<span>legislation. This committee decides which house a bill will start in, recommends to the Cabinet</span>\n<span>which proposals will be in the Queen's Speech, which will be published in draft and how much</span>\n<span>parliamentary time will be required.[11]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Following a process of consultation, the sponsoring department will send drafting instructions to</span>\n<span>parliamentary counsel, expert lawyers working for the government responsible for writing</span>\n<span>legislation. These instructions will describe what the bill should do but not the detail of how this</span>\n<span>is achieved. The Parliamentary counsel must draft the legislation clearly to minimise the</span>\n<span>possibility of legal challenge and to fit the bill in with existing UK, European Union and delegated</span>\n<span>legislation. A finished bill must be approved or scrutinised by the sponsoring department and</span>\n<span>minister, parliamentary counsel and LP.[13]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The final stage is the submission of the bill to the authorities of the House in which it is to</span>\n<span>start its legislative journey. In the Commons, this is the Clerk of Legislation and the Public Bill</span>\n<span>Office in the Lords. They will check the following:[14]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span> * That the bill complies with the rules of the house</span>\n<span> * That everything in the bill is covered by its 'long title' (text describing the purposes of the</span>\n<span>   bill)</span>\n<span> * In the Commons, that every provision requiring expenditure or levying taxes is identified and</span>\n<span>   printed in italics</span>\n<span> * Whether the Royal Prerogative is affected</span>\n<span> * Whether it conflicts with or duplicates any bill which has already been introduced</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>After this process, the bill is then ready for introduction.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>FIRST READING[EDIT]</span>\n<span>The first reading is a formality and no debate or vote occurs. A notice that a bill is being</span>\n<span>presented for its first reading appears on the Order Paper for that day. The European Union</span>\n<span>(Amendment) Bill appeared on the Order Paper for 17 December 2007 as follows:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Notice of Presentation of Bill</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>1 EUROPEAN UNION (AMENDMENT) [No debate]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Secretary David Miliband</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Bill to make provision in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union</span>\n<span>and the Treaty Establishing the European Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Formal first reading: no debate or decision.[15]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>As we can see in this video footage of the first reading, the MP is called by the Speaker at the</span>\n<span>commencement of public business and brings a 'dummy bill', a sheet of paper with the short and long</span>\n<span>titles and the names of up to twelve supporters, to the Clerk of the House at the Table. The Clerk</span>\n<span>reads out the short title and the Speaker says \"Second reading what day?\" For all government bills,</span>\n<span>the response is almost always \"tomorrow\" (or the next sitting day). A date is also set for private</span>\n<span>members bills; the decision for scheduling such bills is crucial as they are not given 'government</span>\n<span>time' to be debated. The bill is recorded in the proceedings as having been read for a first time,</span>\n<span>having been ordered to be printed and to be read a second time on a particular date.[16] In the case</span>\n<span>of a Government Bill, Explanatory Notes, which try to explain the effect of the Bill in more simple</span>\n<span>language, are also usually ordered to be printed. Again, in the case of the European Union</span>\n<span>(Amendment) Bill this appeared in Hansard as follows:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Secretary David Miliband, supported by the Prime Minister, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.</span>\n<span>Secretary Straw, Secretary Jacqui Smith, Secretary Des Browne, Secretary Alan Johnson, Mr. Secretary</span>\n<span>Alexander, Mr. Secretary Hutton and Mr. Jim Murphy, presented a Bill to make provision in connection</span>\n<span>with the Treaty of Lisbon Amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty Establishing the</span>\n<span>European Community, signed at Lisbon on 13th December 2007: And the same was read the First time,</span>\n<span>ordered to be read a Second time tomorrow, and to be printed. Explanatory notes to be printed [Bill</span>\n<span>48].</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>A bill introduced in this way is known as a presentation bill. Bills can also be introduced in the</span>\n<span>Commons by being brought in from the Lords, being brought in by resolution (like the Finance Bill)</span>\n<span>or when an MP gets leave to bring in a ten-minute rule bill.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>A Government Bill can be introduced first into either House. Bills which begin in the Lords have</span>\n<span>'[Lords]' suffixed to its title when in the Lords and '[HL]' when in the Commons.[8] Bills which</span>\n<span>deal primarily with taxation or public expenditure begin their passage in the Commons since the</span>\n<span>financial privileges of that House mean that it has primacy in these matters (see Parliament Acts</span>\n<span>1911 and 1949). Conversely, bills relating to the judicial system, Law Commission bills and </span>\n<span>consolidation bills begin their passage in the House of Lords which by convention has primacy in</span>\n<span>these matters.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>SECOND READING[EDIT]</span>\n<span>In the second reading, which in theory is supposed to occur two weekends after the first reading, a</span>\n<span>debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote. This is the main opportunity to</span>\n<span>debate the principle of the bill rather than individual clauses. A division at this stage,</span>\n<span>therefore, represents a direct challenge to the principle of the bill. If the bill is read a second</span>\n<span>time, it proceeds to the committee stage.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Normally, the Second Reading of a Government bill is approved. A defeat for a Government bill on</span>\n<span>this Reading usually signifies a major loss. The last time this happened was at the second reading</span>\n<span>of the Shops Bill for the government of Margaret Thatcher in 1986. The bill, which liberalised</span>\n<span>controls on Sunday trading, was defeated in the Commons by 14 votes.[17][18]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Second reading debates on government bills usually take a day, in practice about six hours. Smaller</span>\n<span>and less controversial bills will receive less time and wholly uncontroversial measures will receive</span>\n<span>a second reading 'on the nod' with no debate whatsoever.[19] The National Insurance Contributions</span>\n<span>bill appeared in the Order Papers as follows:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Main Business</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>3 NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS BILL: Second Reading. [Until 10.00 p.m.]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Debate may continue until 10.00 p.m.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>As we can see from video footage of the debate for this bill, second readings of government bills</span>\n<span>take place on a motion moved (for Government bills) by a minister in the department responsible for</span>\n<span>the legislation \"that the bill now be read a second time\". The minister outlines the overall purpose</span>\n<span>of the Bill and highlights particular parts of the Bill they consider most important. The official</span>\n<span>Opposition spokesperson responds with his or her views on the Bill. The debate continues with other</span>\n<span>Opposition parties and backbench MPs giving their opinions on the principles of the Bill.[20] The</span>\n<span>minister will eventually bring the debate to a conclusion by saying, of the bill, \"I commend it to</span>\n<span>the House\". The Speaker will then put the question by saying, for example, \"The Question is, that</span>\n<span>the Bill be now read a second time\". The Speaker then invites supporters of the bill to say \"aye\"</span>\n<span>and then opponents say \"no\": first he says, \"All members of that opinion say 'aye'\", and supporters</span>\n<span>say 'aye'; then the speaker says \"contrary 'no'\", and opponents say 'no'. In what is known as </span>\n<span>collecting the voices the Speaker makes a judgement as to the loudest cry. A clear majority, either</span>\n<span>way, will prompt the response \"I think the Ayes/Noes have it\" (this can be forced to a division by</span>\n<span>continued cries either way). If the result is at all in doubt a division will be called and the</span>\n<span>Speaker will say \"Division. Clear the Lobby\". This refers not to the division lobbies used for</span>\n<span>voting but the Members' Lobby beyond the chamber which is cleared by the doorkeepers. At this point, </span>\n<span>division bells will ring throughout the palace and also in nearby flats, pubs and restaurants whose</span>\n<span>owners pay to be connected to the system. This allows MPs who may not be in the debate to come and</span>\n<span>vote on the issue in question.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>After two minutes, the Speaker will put the Question again to assess whether there is still</span>\n<span>disagreement. He will then name the tellers, whose job it is to count the votes. These will usually</span>\n<span>be government and opposition whips. In the example we have looked at: \"Tellers for the Ayes Mr. Dave</span>\n<span>Watts and Mr. Steve McCabe; tellers for the Noes Mr. Nick Hurd and Mr. John Baron\". If no teller has</span>\n<span>come forward (or only one) the Speaker declares the result for the other side.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>One teller from each side goes to the end of each division lobby and they count MPs as they emerge.</span>\n<span>Whips are also at the other end of the lobby to try to ensure that their MPs vote with the party</span>\n<span>line. The names are taken by division clerks and are published in Hansard the next day (see example</span>\n<span>from Hansard or with greater clarity from the Public Whip). Eight minutes after first calling the</span>\n<span>division, the Speaker says \"lock the doors\"; the doorkeepers lock the doors leading into the lobbies</span>\n<span>and no more MPs can get in to vote. When every member has passed the division clerks and tellers, a </span>\n<span>division slip is produced by the Clerks at the Table and is given to one of the tellers on the</span>\n<span>winning side. The tellers then form up at the Table in front of the Mace facing the Speaker, and the</span>\n<span>teller with the slip reads the result to the House, for example: \"The Ayes to the right, 291. The</span>\n<span>Noes to the left, 161\". The Clerk then takes the slip to the Speaker, who repeats the result and</span>\n<span>adds \"So the Ayes have it, the Ayes have it. Unlock.\" The doorkeepers then unlock the doors to the</span>\n<span>division lobbies.[21] A division vote concerning a National Insurance Contributions Bill is</span>\n<span>illustrated from Hansard as follows:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Question put, That the Bill be now read a Second time:—</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The House divided: Ayes 291, Noes 161.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Division No. 033</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>7.56 pm</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>AYES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted Aye]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>NOES [followed by list of MPs and tellers who voted No]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Question accordingly agreed to.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Bill read a Second time.[22]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Divisions on second readings can be on a straight opposition or a vote on a 'reasoned amendment',</span>\n<span>detailing the reasons the bill's opponents do not want it read a second time, which may be selected</span>\n<span>by the Speaker. Bills defeated at a second reading cannot progress further or be reintroduced with</span>\n<span>exactly the same wording in the same session.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>PROCEDURAL ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>In the case of Government Bills, the House normally passes forthwith (i.e. without debate but almost</span>\n<span>always with a vote) a Programme Order in the form of a programme motion, setting out the timetable</span>\n<span>for the committee and remaining stages of the Bill. This takes place immediately after the second</span>\n<span>reading.[17] For example:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span> National Insurance Contributions Bill (Programme) </span>\n<span>Motion made, and Question put forthwith, pursuant to Standing Order No. 83A (Programme motions), </span>\n<span>That the following provisions shall apply to the National Insurance Contributions Bill: </span>\n<span>Committal </span>\n<span>1. The Bill shall be committed to a Public Bill Committee. </span>\n<span>Proceedings in Public Bill Committee. </span>\n<span>2. Proceedings in the Public Bill Committee shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to</span>\n<span>a conclusion on 22nd January 2008. </span>\n<span>3. The Public Bill Committee shall have leave to sit twice on the first day on which it meets. </span>\n<span>Consideration and Third Reading </span>\n<span>4. Proceedings on consideration shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a</span>\n<span>conclusion one hour before the moment of interruption on the day on which those proceedings are</span>\n<span>commenced. </span>\n<span>5. Proceedings on Third Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a</span>\n<span>conclusion at the moment of interruption on that day. </span>\n<span>6. Standing Order No. 83B (Programming committees) shall not apply to proceedings on consideration</span>\n<span>and Third Reading. </span>\n<span>Other proceedings </span>\n<span>7. Any other proceedings on the Bill (including any proceedings on consideration of Lords Amendments</span>\n<span>or on any further messages from the Lords) may be programmed. —[Tony Cunningham.] </span>\n<span>Question agreed to.[23] </span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The House may also pass a separate money resolution, authorising any expenditure arising from the</span>\n<span>Bill; and/or a ways and means resolution, authorising any new taxes or charges the Bill creates.</span>\n<span>Bills are not programmed in the House of Lords.[17]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>COMMITTEE STAGE[EDIT]</span>\n<span>This usually takes place in a standing committee in the Commons and on the Floor of the House in the</span>\n<span>Lords. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons utilises the following committees on bills:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span> * Standing Committee: Despite the name, a standing committee is a committee specifically</span>\n<span>   constituted for a certain bill. Its membership reflects the strengths of the parties in the</span>\n<span>   House. It is now known as a Public Bill Committee.[24]</span>\n<span> * Special Standing Committee: The committee investigates the issues and principles of the bill</span>\n<span>   before sending it to a regular Standing Committee. This procedure has been used very rarely in</span>\n<span>   recent years (the Adoption and Children Bill in 2001–2002 is the only recent example); the pre-</span>\n<span>   legislative scrutiny process (see above) is now preferred. This type of committee is now also</span>\n<span>   known as a Special Public Bill Committee.</span>\n<span> * Select Committee: A specialised committee that normally conducts oversight hearings for a certain</span>\n<span>   Department considers the bill. This procedure has not been used in recent years, with the</span>\n<span>   exception of the quinquennial Armed Forces Bill, which is always referred to a select committee.</span>\n<span> * Committee of the Whole House: The whole house sits as a committee in the House of Commons to</span>\n<span>   consider a bill. Bills usually considered in this way are the principal parts of the annual </span>\n<span>   Finance Bill (the 'budget'), bills of first-class constitutional importance (for example, the </span>\n<span>   European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018), and bills that are so uncontroversial that the committee</span>\n<span>   stage may be dispensed with quickly and easily on the floor of the House, without the need to</span>\n<span>   nominate a committee (some Private Members' Bills are usually dealt with this way each year).</span>\n<span>   This is also the procedure used in the Lords.</span>\n<span> * Grand Committee (House of Lords): This is a recent new procedure used for some bills which is</span>\n<span>   intended to speed up business. Although it takes place in a separate room, it is technically</span>\n<span>   still a committee of the whole House in that all members can attend and participate. Procedure is</span>\n<span>   the same as for a Committee in the main Chamber, but there are no votes.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The committee considers each clause of the bill and may make amendments to it. Significant</span>\n<span>amendments may be made at committee stage. In some cases, whole groups of clauses are inserted or</span>\n<span>removed. However, almost all the amendments which are agreed to in committee will have been tabled</span>\n<span>by the Government to correct deficiencies in the bill, to enact changes to policy made since the</span>\n<span>bill was introduced (or, in some cases, to import material which was not ready when the bill was</span>\n<span>presented), or to reflect concessions made as a result of earlier debate.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>REPORT STAGE[EDIT]</span>\n<span>The report state, known formally as \"consideration\", takes place on the Floor of the House, and is a</span>\n<span>further opportunity to amend the bill. Unlike committee stage, the House need not consider every</span>\n<span>clause of the bill, only those to which amendments have been tabled.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>THIRD READING[EDIT]</span>\n<span>In the third reading, a debate on the final text of the bill, as amended. In the Lords, further</span>\n<span>amendments may be made on third reading, in the Commons, it is usually a short debate followed by a</span>\n<span>single vote; amendments are not permitted.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>PASSAGE[EDIT]</span>\n<span>The bill is then sent to the other House (to the Lords, if it originated in the Commons; to the</span>\n<span>Commons if it is a Lords bill), which may amend it. The Commons may reject a bill from the Lords</span>\n<span>outright; the Lords may amend a bill from the Commons but, if they reject it, the Commons may force</span>\n<span>it through without the Lords' consent in the following Session of Parliament, as is detailed below.</span>\n<span>Furthermore, the Lords can neither initiate nor amend money bills (bills dealing exclusively with</span>\n<span>public expenditure or the raising of revenue; whether a bill is a money bill is decided by the</span>\n<span>Speaker of the House of Commons). If the other House amends the bill, the bill and amendments are</span>\n<span>sent back for a further stage.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>There is a constitutional convention that the House of Lords should not spend more than 60 days over</span>\n<span>bills sent to them by the Commons.[25]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>The Parliament Acts: Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, which do not apply for bills seeking</span>\n<span>to extend Parliament's length to more than five years, if the Lords reject a bill originated in the</span>\n<span>House of Commons, then the Commons may pass that bill again in the next session. The bill is then</span>\n<span>submitted for Royal Assent even though the Lords did not pass it. Also, if the Lords do not approve</span>\n<span>of a money bill within thirty days of passage in the Commons, the bill is submitted for Royal Assent</span>\n<span>nevertheless.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>The House in which the bill originated considers the amendments made in the other House. It may</span>\n<span>agree to them, amend them, propose other amendments in lieu or reject them. A bill may pass</span>\n<span>backwards and forwards several times at this stage, as each House amends or rejects changes proposed</span>\n<span>by the other (a process referred to colloquially as parliamentary ping-pong). If each House insists</span>\n<span>on disagreeing with the other, the bill is lost under the 'double insistence' rule, unless avoiding</span>\n<span>action is taken.[26]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>ENACTING FORMULA[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Each Act commences with one of the following:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Standard:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Be it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of</span>\n<span>the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the</span>\n<span>authority of the same, as follows:-[27]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>For money bills:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament</span>\n<span>assembled, towards raising the necessary supplies to defray Your Majesty's public expenses, and</span>\n<span>making an addition to the public revenue, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and grant</span>\n<span>unto Your Majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech</span>\n<span>Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent</span>\n<span>Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in</span>\n<span>this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Without consent of the Lords, under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of</span>\n<span>the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the</span>\n<span>Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>DEVOLUTION[EDIT]</span>\n<span>As a result of devolution, the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the </span>\n<span>Scottish Parliament are also able to create primary legislation for their respective devolved</span>\n<span>institutions. These devolved legislatures are able to create legislation regarding all but reserved</span>\n<span>and excepted matters. However, Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom remain supreme and can</span>\n<span>overrule the devolved legislatures. By convention, the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not</span>\n<span>normally do this without a legislative consent motion.[28][29][30]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>SOVEREIGNTY[EDIT]</span>\n<span>In the UK there is still a presumption that Parliament is sovereign; however, it is recognised that</span>\n<span>\"Acts of Parliament are no longer sovereign but can be overruled if they are incompatible with </span>\n<span>European Laws\".[31] Within that constraint Acts of Parliament are generally without limit. European</span>\n<span>law can overturn such Acts because the European Communities Act 1972 agreed that UK law should not</span>\n<span>wish to conflict with European Law. However, if Parliament decided to, it could withdraw from the</span>\n<span>European Union and withdraw from all European law. Parliament has also devolved significant powers</span>\n<span>to the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the National Assembly for Wales, it is</span>\n<span>free to overrule or even abolish those institutions, although this would be unlikely in practice. (A</span>\n<span>recent instance when it did was the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 (which</span>\n<span>decriminalized abortion and required the Secretary of State to legalize same-sex marriage despite</span>\n<span>health and social policy being devolved matters), due in part to the fact that the Assembly was not</span>\n<span>sitting due to ongoing political conflicts.)</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>British law is also made through Statutory Instruments (SIs). These are laws which are made in the</span>\n<span>name of a government minister, exercising legislative powers delegated to him or her by Act of</span>\n<span>Parliament (known as the parent Act or enabling Act). Some of these must be approved by Parliament</span>\n<span>before they can become law, others need only be laid before Parliament a certain number of days</span>\n<span>(usually 40) before coming into force. They are used because they are much faster and simpler to</span>\n<span>implement than a full Act of Parliament, and are more easily amended to reflect changing</span>\n<span>circumstances. Provided they fall within the power delegated by the enabling Act, they have the same</span>\n<span>force as an Act of Parliament, and much of the UK's law is made in this way. There are thousands of</span>\n<span>SIs each year, compared with around 50 Acts. Statutory Instruments are also used to bring Acts into</span>\n<span>force. Most Acts have sections that come into effect upon Royal Assent, or at a set date thereafter.</span>\n<span>However, other sections are brought into force using an SI which is titled [Act Name] (Commencement</span>\n<span>No. #) Order. Whilst most legislation has had a maximum of half a dozen Commencement Orders, this is</span>\n<span>not a strict limit as some Acts have had over 10.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Nothing can bind Parliament as a successive parliament can repeal the legislation.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>International treaties are not effective in domestic UK law until enforced by an Act of Parliament</span>\n<span>(e.g. The European Communities Act, which brought the UK into the European Union, the Single</span>\n<span>European Act which allowed for the creation of the single European internal market or the Outer</span>\n<span>Space Act which deals with international treaties on Space).</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>HISTORICAL RECORDS[EDIT]</span>\n<span>At the end of a medieval Parliament of England a collection of Acts of a public character was made</span>\n<span>in the form of a Statute Roll and given the title of the King’s regnal year; each particular Act</span>\n<span>forming a section, or a chapter, of the complete Statute, so that, e.g. the Vagabonds Act 1383 </span>\n<span>became VII Ric. II, c.5. Enrolment of Public Acts on manuscript parchment \"Parliament Rolls\"</span>\n<span>continued until 1850.[32] The longest Act of Parliament in the form of a scroll is an Act regarding</span>\n<span>taxation passed in 1821. It is nearly a quarter of a mile (348 m) long, and used to take two men a</span>\n<span>whole day to rewind.[33] Until 1850, a paper draft was brought into the House in which the Bill</span>\n<span>started; after the committee stage there the Bill was inscribed on a parchment roll and this</span>\n<span>parchment was then passed to the other House which could introduce amendments. The original Bill was</span>\n<span>never re-written and knives were used to scrape away the script from the top surface of the rolls</span>\n<span>before the new text was added. Since 1850 two copies of each Act were printed on vellum, one for</span>\n<span>preservation in the House of Lords and the other for transmission to the Public Record Office.[34]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Since 1483 annual volumes of Public Acts (\"Statute Books\") have been printed. In these volumes not</span>\n<span>only Public Acts but also some Private Acts and various \"Local and Personal Acts declared Public\"</span>\n<span>have been included.[32]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>All UK Acts of Parliament since 1497 are kept in the House of Lords Record Office, including the</span>\n<span>oldest Act: The \"Taking of Apprentices for Worsteads in the County of Norfolk\" Act 1497, a reference</span>\n<span>to the wool worstedmanufacture at Worstead in Norfolk, England.[33]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Acts passed before 1 January 1963 are cited by session and chapter. The session of parliament in</span>\n<span>which the Act was passed is referred to by the regnal year or years of the reigning Monarch and his</span>\n<span>name, which is usually abbreviated. So, for example, the Treason Act 1945 may be cited:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>REGNAL YEAR OR YEARS   MONARCH   ABBREVIATION OF \"CHAPTER\"   CHAPTER NUMBER   </span>\n<span>8 & 9                  Geo 6     c                           44               </span>\n<span></span>\n<span>All Acts passed on or after 1 January 1963 are cited by calendar year and chapter.[35]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>All recent Acts have a short title, or citation (e.g. Local Government Act 2003, National Health</span>\n<span>Service Act 1974).</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>Many Acts of a private, personal or local character often have not ever been printed, surviving only</span>\n<span>in a single manuscript copy in the Victoria Tower.[36]</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>ACTS IN FORCE[EDIT]</span>\n<span>The UK's Ministry of Justice publishes most Acts of Parliament in an online statute law database. It</span>\n<span>is the official revised edition of the primary legislation of the United Kingdom. The database shows</span>\n<span>Acts as amended by subsequent legislation and is the statute book of UK legislation.</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>ACTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE[EDIT]</span>\n<span>Important acts in UK constitutional history include:</span>\n<span></span>\n<span> * Magna Carta – first law to limit the powers of the Monarch</span>\n<span> * Treason Act 1351 – codified the existing common law relating to treason.</span>\n<span> * Succession to the Crown Act 1533 – altered the succession by declaring Henry VIII's first</span>\n<span>   daughter Mary ineligible to the throne.</span>\n<span> * Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 – annexed Wales to England.</span>\n<span> * Succession to the Crown Act 1536 – removed both of Henry VIII's daughters (Mary and Elizabeth)</span>\n<span>   from being eligible to the throne.</span>\n<span> * Crown of Ireland Act 1542 – created the office of King of Ireland.</span>\n<span> * Succession to the Crown Act 1543 – Reinstated both of Henry VIII's daughters in the line of</span>\n<span>   succession behind his son, establishing the principle of male-preference primogeniture.</span>\n<span> * Petition of Right (1628) – sets out specific liberties which the Monarch was prohibited from</span>\n<span>   infringing.</span>\n<span> * Habeas Corpus Act 1679 – forced courts to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention.</span>\n<span> * Bill of Rights 1689 – placed (or restated) limits on the monarch's power, formalising </span>\n<span>   constitutional monarchy.</span>\n<span> * Act of Settlement 1701 – established the line of succession for the monarchy through the</span>\n<span>   Protestant Sophia, Electress of Hanover, disinheriting all Catholics and those who married</span>\n<span>   Catholics.</span>\n<span> * Act of Union 1707 – united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into Great Britain, abolishing</span>\n<span>   the Parliament of Scotland</span>\n<span> * Act of Union 1800 – united the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland into the United Kingdom of</span>\n<span>   Great Britain and Ireland</span>\n<span> * Reform Act 1832 – with later Reform Acts and Representation of the People Acts, made election to</span>\n<span>   the House of Commons uniform, abolished the undemocratic rotten boroughs, and created new</span>\n<span>   constituencies for newly populous industrial cities such as Birmingham</span>\n<span> * Parliament Act 1911 (amended 1949) – allowed the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords</span>\n<span>   after a delay</span>\n<span> * Welsh Church Act 1914 (in force 1920) – disestablished the state church in Wales, creating the </span>\n<span>   Church in Wales</span>\n<span> * Representation of the People Act 1918 (amended 1928) – extended the right to vote to women</span>\n<span> * Statute of Westminster 1931 – gave constitutional independence to the British dominions overseas.</span>\n<span>   Numerous powers of legislative and judicial dependency remained; several more Acts have</span>\n<span>   restricted or abolished these powers, for example the Canada Act 1982.</span>\n<span> * His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 – passed the abdication of King Edward VIII into</span>\n<span>   law</span>\n<span> * Ireland Act 1949 – formally recognised the modern Republic of Ireland by the United Kingdom and</span>\n<span>   abolished the monarchy in Ireland outside of Northern Ireland</span>\n<span> * European Communities Act 1972 – made the UK part of what is now the European Union providing for</span>\n<span>   the application of European law</span>\n<span> * Human Rights Act 1998 – enshrined the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law,</span>\n<span>   affecting government decision making, interpretation of law, and appeals</span>\n<span> * House of Lords Act 1999 – removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of</span>\n<span>   Lords, leaving 92 seats reserved for hereditary peers to be filled by election by other eligible</span>\n<span>   lords</span>\n<span> * Northern Ireland Act 1998 – established a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and passed the Good</span>\n<span>   Friday Agreement into law</span>\n<span> * Scotland Act 1998 – established a devolved Scottish Parliament</span>\n<span> * Government of Wales Act 1998 – created a devolved National Assembly for Wales</span>\n<span> * Greater London Authority Act 1999 – established an elected Mayor of London and an assembly for</span>\n<span>   Greater London</span>\n<span> * Constitutional Reform Act 2005 - established the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and reformed</span>\n<span>   the office of Lord Chancellor</span>\n<span> * Government of Wales Act 2006 – conferred additional law-making powers to the National Assembly</span>\n<span>   for Wales</span>\n<span> * Northern Ireland Act 2009 – devolved policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly,</span>\n<span>   averting the assembly from being abolished</span>\n<span> * Scotland Act 2012 – conferred additional powers to the Scottish Parliament</span>\n<span> * Succession to the Crown Act 2013 – established absolute progenitor primogeniture in succession to</span>\n<span>   the Crown (abolishing male preference), and removed disqualification from those who marry</span>\n<span>   Catholics, implementing the Perth Agreementbetween countries sharing the UK's monarch</span>\n<span> * Wales Act 2017 – changed Welsh devolution to the reserved powers model</span>\n<span> * European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 – enables transposition of EU law into UK law, repeals the</span>\n<span>   European Communities Act 1972, and specifies processes and deadlines for ratifying a withdrawal</span>\n<span>   agreement</span>\n<span></span>\n<span>SEE ALSO[EDIT]</span>\n<span>FURTHER READING[EDIT]</span>\n<span>REFERENCES[EDIT]</span>\n<span> 1.   ^ Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42).
